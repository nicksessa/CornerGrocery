# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The goal of this project is to count and display grocery items that are provided in a text file.

# What did you do particularly well?

I wouldn't say I did anything particularly well, just adequate.  The code presents a menu, does some input validation and outputs the data as requested.  Nothing special, really.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

There are literally limitless ways to enhance the code.  For one, handling the input validation in a better and more efficient way.  Asking the user for the location of the input and output files would also be an improvement.  Removing the case sensitivity on the search would also most likely be an improvement.  

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

As a non object oriented programmer, I felt that all the object oriented pieces were very difficult.  To overcome this, I watched a lot of YouTube videos and took pieces from existing code I found in various places.  StackOverflow, YouTube and Udemy are the best places to get help, in my opinion.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The part with the 'set list' seems to be the main thing that will come in handy later on.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made the program maintainable by breaking functions into smaller chuncks and providing lots of comments.
